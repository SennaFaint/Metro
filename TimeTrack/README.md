# TimeTrack v2 - Enhanced Manager Dashboard with Collapsible Store Cards

## Overview

This updated version of TimeTrack features a completely redesigned **Manager Dashboard** with **collapsible store cards** that provide a clean, organized view of all stores. Each store card starts in a simple, compact state and expands to reveal comprehensive details when the manager clicks "Manage Store".

---

## Key Features

### 1. **Collapsible Store Cards**

The manager dashboard now displays stores in a clean, minimal format by default. Each store card shows:

- **Store name** in a beautiful gradient header (purple/blue theme)
- **Active status badge** indicating the store is operational
- **"Manage Store" button** to expand and view detailed information

When you click the **"Manage Store"** button, the card smoothly expands to reveal:

- Quick statistics dashboard
- Employee clock in/out status
- Inventory preview with color-coded quantities
- Latest end of day financial report

The button changes to **"Hide Details"** when expanded, allowing you to collapse the card back to its simple state.

### 2. **Quick Stats Dashboard** ðŸ“Š

When expanded, each store card displays four key metrics at the top:

- **Total Inventory**: Shows total quantity and number of unique items in stock
- **Low Stock Alerts**: Highlights items needing attention (â‰¤3 units) and out-of-stock count
- **Employee Activity**: Displays total employees who worked today and currently clocked in count
- **EOD Reports**: Shows total reports submitted and the latest submission date

These color-coded info boxes provide instant visibility into store health.

### 3. **Employee Clock In/Out Tracking** ðŸ‘¥

Real-time employee status with visual indicators:

- Shows all employees who clocked in or out today
- **Green badge and border** for currently clocked in employees
- **Red badge and border** for clocked out employees
- Displays clock in/out times and work duration
- Clean, easy-to-read employee cards

### 4. **Inventory Preview** ðŸ“¦

Quick inventory overview showing the top 8 items:

- Displayed in a responsive grid layout
- **Color-coded quantities** for instant stock level assessment:
  - **Red (0)**: Out of stock - immediate attention needed
  - **Orange (1-3)**: Low stock - reorder soon
  - **Green (4+)**: Adequate stock - no action needed

### 5. **Latest End of Day Report** ðŸ’°

Financial summary showing the most recent EOD submission:

- Date of the report
- Cash, Credit, and QPay payment breakdowns
- Total amount prominently displayed
- Professional table format with clear labels
